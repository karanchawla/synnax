## Prerequisites

This page assumes you've already:

- [Started a cluster](/deploy/get-started)
- [Installed the Synnax console](/console/get-started)

## Adding a New Cluster

Connecting a new Synnax cluster is as simple as opening on the cluster dropdown in
the bottom right corner, and clciking on the **Add** button in the top right corner of the
dialog.

<Video client:only="react" id="console/connect-a-cluster" />

You can use the **Test Connection** button to verify that the connection parameters are 
correct and that the console can connect to the cluster. Then, click the **Done** button
to add a new cluster to the list.

The console will continuously monitor connection to the cluster and display it in the 
bottom right corner of the UI.
